# Getting Sick After Seeing a Doctor? Diagnosing and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Event Temporal Reasoning

This is the code repo for the NAACL 2024 Findings paper [Getting Sick After Seeing a Doctor? Diagnosing and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Event Temporal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14970).

There are two sets of experiments on two dataset, TORQUE and MATRES.

### TORQUE

Code for Counterfactual Data Augmentation: `cf_gen`

GPT-3 in-context learning experiments: `gpt3`

### MATRES:

The code is adapted from https://github.com/why2011btv/Faithful_TempRel.

Example: `scripts/train_baseline.sh`

Counterfactual generation: `cf_gen`

GPT3 in-context learning experiments: `gpt3`.
